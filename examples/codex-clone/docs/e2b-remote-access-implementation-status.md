# E2B Remote Access Implementation Status

## Implementation Date: 2025-06-19

### Summary
Successfully implemented comprehensive remote access features for E2B sandboxes including terminal access, VS Code integration, and SSH configuration support.

## Completed Features

### 1. Terminal Access ✅
- Web-based terminal embedded in the UI
- Available at `https://{sandboxId}.e2b.dev/terminal`
- Integrated into the task view with split-panel layout
- Full terminal emulation with iframe embedding

### 2. Application Viewing/Port Forwarding ✅
- Automatic port detection for common services:
  - React/Next.js (3000)
  - Vite (5173)
  - Express (4000)
  - Flask/Node (5000)
  - And more...
- Live preview with auto-refresh
- Port forwarding via E2B proxy URLs

### 3. VS Code Access ✅
- **Web-based VS Code**: `https://{sandboxId}.e2b.dev/code`
- **Enhanced SSH Instructions**: 
  - Copy-paste SSH config generation
  - Step-by-step connection guide
  - VS Code Remote SSH command generation
- Integrated into the UI with dedicated tabs

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files:
1. `/app/task/[id]/_components/sandbox-terminal.tsx` - Dedicated terminal component (not currently used but available)
2. `/components/ui/alert.tsx` - Alert UI component for user feedback
3. `/docs/remote-access-guide.md` - Comprehensive user guide
4. `/docs/e2b-remote-access-implementation-status.md` - This status file

### Modified Files:
1. `/app/task/[id]/_components/live-preview.tsx` - Enhanced with SSH instructions and copy functionality
2. `/app/task/[id]/_components/task-timeline.tsx` - Fixed import issues
3. `/app/task/[id]/client-page.tsx` - Already had terminal/VS Code integration

## Key Implementation Details

### SSH Configuration
The system generates SSH config entries like:
```bash
Host e2b-{sandboxId}
  HostName {sandboxId}.e2b.dev
  User user
  Port 22
  StrictHostKeyChecking no
  UserKnownHostsFile /dev/null
  ForwardAgent yes
```

### VS Code Connection Command
```bash
code --remote ssh-remote+e2b-{sandboxId} /home/user/
```

### UI Integration
- Terminal and VS Code tabs in the preview panel
- Copy-to-clipboard buttons for all commands
- Clear instructions in the Tools section
- Alert components for user guidance

## Testing Status

### What to Test:
1. Create a new task that starts an E2B sandbox
2. Wait for sandbox to initialize
3. Check the preview panel for:
   - Terminal tab functionality
   - VS Code tab functionality
   - Tools section with SSH instructions
   - Copy buttons working correctly
4. Test port forwarding with a running application
5. Verify all connection URLs work

### Known Issues:
- Build has some ESLint warnings (non-critical)
- Direct SSH may not be available (E2B limitation)
- Some OpenTelemetry module warnings (can be ignored)

## Next Steps (Optional)

1. **Terminal Enhancement**: 
   - Consider using xterm.js for better terminal emulation
   - Add WebSocket support for real-time terminal interaction

2. **SSH Key Management**:
   - Add SSH key generation/management UI
   - Automatic key deployment to sandboxes

3. **Performance**:
   - Optimize iframe loading
   - Add loading states for terminal/VS Code

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Better error messages when sandbox is not available
   - Retry logic for connection failures

## Git Status
- Branch: `feature/diffs`
- Last Commit: `f8eac7e` - "feat: enhance E2B sandbox remote access with VS Code SSH support"
- All changes committed

## Environment
- Development server runs on port 3002 (3000 was in use)
- Access at: http://localhost:3002

## How to Resume Work

1. Navigate to the project:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/jkneen/Documents/GitHub/flows/vibekit/examples/codex-clone
   ```

2. Start the dev server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Key files to reference:
   - Implementation: `/app/task/[id]/_components/live-preview.tsx`
   - Documentation: `/docs/remote-access-guide.md`
   - Task view: `/app/task/[id]/client-page.tsx`

4. Test by creating a task and checking the remote access features

## Technical Context

### E2B Integration Points:
- Sandbox creation: `/src/services/sandbox.ts`
- Container info: `/app/actions/inngest.ts` - `getE2BContainerConnectionsAction`
- Task store: `/stores/tasks.ts`

### UI Components:
- Preview panel with terminal/VS Code tabs
- Tools section with connection details
- Copy-to-clipboard functionality
- Alert components for user feedback

This implementation provides a comprehensive solution for remote access to E2B sandboxes, making it easy for developers to work with their cloud development environments.
