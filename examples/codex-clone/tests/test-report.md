   - Multiple issues:
     - `inngest.send is not a function`
     - `useRouter.mockReturnValue is not a function`
     - Component rendering failures

## Detailed Failure Analysis

### 1. Router Mock Issues (Multiple test files)

Both integration test files failed due to incorrect router mock setup:

```
TypeError: useRouter.mockReturnValue is not a function
```

**Affected files:**
- tests/integration/task-flow.test.tsx (8 tests)
- tests/integration/inngest-flow.test.ts (5 tests)

**Root Cause:** The tests are trying to use `useRouter` as a Jest mock but it's not properly imported or configured for Vitest.

### 2. Component Rendering Issues (tests/components/task-list.test.tsx)

Multiple failures related to component rendering and DOM queries:

**Common Issues:**
- Elements not found in DOM: "Unable to find an element with the text: Recent"
- Navigation not working in JSDOM environment
- State updates not wrapped in act()
- Archive functionality not working as expected

**Warnings:**
- `motion() is deprecated. Use motion.create() instead`
- `Error: Not implemented: navigation (except hash changes)`
- React act() warnings for state updates

### 3. New Inngest Test Issues

The newly created Inngest lifecycle tests revealed several problems:

**tests/inngest/task-lifecycle.test.ts:**
- Build error: Missing `resumeTask` function that doesn't exist in the codebase
- Needs to be created or test needs to be updated

**tests/inngest/sandbox-lifecycle.test.ts:**
- All 10 tests failed with: `inngest.send is not a function`
- Mock setup doesn't match actual Inngest client API

**tests/inngest/realtime-updates.test.ts:**
- All 3 tests failed with: `taskChannel is not a function`
- Missing channel utility function that tests expect

**tests/integration/inngest-flow.test.ts:**
- Combination of router mock issues and Inngest client mock issues
- Component rendering failures due to missing dependencies

## Coverage Information

Coverage reporting was enabled but detailed metrics were not captured in the output. To get full coverage details, run:

```bash
npm run test -- --coverage --coverage.reporter=html
```

## Recommendations

### Immediate Fixes Required:

1. **Fix Router Mocking**
   - Update all integration tests to use Vitest-compatible mocks
   - Replace `useRouter.mockReturnValue` with proper `vi.mocked()` patterns
   - Consider using `vi.mock('next/navigation')` instead of Jest patterns

2. **Fix Component Tests**
   - Ensure test data matches expected component structure
   - Wrap state updates in `act()` from React Testing Library
   - Mock navigation properly for JSDOM environment

3. **Fix New Inngest Tests**
   - Create missing `resumeTask` function or update tests
   - Fix Inngest client mocks to match actual API (use proper mock structure)
   - Add missing `taskChannel` utility function or update imports
   - Review Inngest documentation for proper testing patterns

4. **Update Dependencies**
   - Warning about mixed Vitest versions (3.2.4 vs 3.2.3)
   - Run `npm update` to ensure all test dependencies are aligned

### Code Quality Issues:

1. **Deprecated APIs**
   - Update motion library usage to use `motion.create()`

2. **Test Environment**
   - Configure JSDOM properly for navigation tests
   - Consider using MSW for API mocking instead of manual mocks

## Test Execution Command

Tests were executed using:
```bash
npm run test -- --run --coverage
```

## Next Steps

1. Fix the router mock issues in all integration tests (13 tests affected)
2. Update component tests to handle async rendering properly
3. Fix or remove the broken Inngest lifecycle tests:
   - Either implement missing functions (resumeTask, taskChannel)
   - Or update tests to match actual implementation
4. Ensure all test dependencies are at compatible versions
5. Add proper coverage thresholds in vitest.config.ts
6. Consider adding E2E tests for critical user flows

## New Test Suite Analysis

The newly added Inngest lifecycle tests are currently non-functional due to:

1. **Missing Implementation:**
   - `resumeTask` function doesn't exist
   - `taskChannel` utility is not implemented

2. **Mock Issues:**
   - Inngest client mock doesn't match the actual API
   - Tests expect `.send()` method but mock doesn't provide it

3. **Integration Complexity:**
   - Tests try to test complex async flows without proper setup
   - Missing dependencies and improper isolation

**Recommendation:** Either implement the missing functionality or simplify the tests to match the current implementation.
